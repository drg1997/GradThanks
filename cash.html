    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>If you're anyhting like me, you want to write graduation Thank you cards, but you just don't have the time.  But fret not, becuase I used all the time I could be writing thank you cards to make this joke website for my own amusement.  With the amazing GradThanks program you simply enter the gifters name, how much money they give you, your name, and one of your interests, and the complicated computer program will write you a message!  And to make things better, the program can even decide how heartfelt the message is based on how much money they gave you!</p>
